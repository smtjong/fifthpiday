            On Valentine's Day, John invited Sam to a Mexican place for dinner. John got Sam a box full of heart-shaped macarons that he ventured out and got lost on the TTC for. With the gift, he gave her a birthday card. Sam was confused but either way, she enjoyed the dinner and the macarons. Neither of them mentioned that it was Valentine's Day that day. Apparently John was going to confess with a Valentine's Day card, but Sam said something that day that made him think she didn't like him that way. So he gave her the birthday card as his Plan B.
