            Being together was a lot of fun. They had some arguments here and there but always managed to make up. In their first summer term together at school, they had a great time. They listened to Studio Ghibli music. They drove around everywhere with John's Pontiac Sunfire named Wanda. They got into a lot of funny shenanigans and even landed in the campus police's office at some point. John got fat from eating more desserts in his daily life. Sam got hair like an alpaca from accidentally cutting her bangs too short. But they were so happy together, none of that mattered.
