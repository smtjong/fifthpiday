            First year of full-time, after graduating, was challenging but in a good way, as they both went for an early promotion and studied for the CA outside of work (as well as the CFA for John). He was a genius in finding supplementary courses for the CA at a college to make up for the ones their university failed to offer. He ended up commuting between his home in Oakville, work site in Cambridge, and college classes in North York... sometimes staying over at Sam's place in Markham after class ended at 10pm. How he was able to pull that off while getting promoted plus passing the Level 2 CFA still baffles Sam to this day.
