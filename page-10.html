            A month after Valentine's Day, John sent Sam a weird Kakao message saying something along the lines of “I love you”. Sam asked if he wanted to talk about it. When they met up, at a conference room in the office, John said Sam was “pretty decent” and would like to try dating. In return, Sam said John was “pretty decent” too, and agreed that they could give it a shot. They were finally official.
            <br>Fun Fact: This actually happened on Friday, March 13th, but to avoid having an anniversary date that fell on future Friday the 13ths, they had their first date the next day and made their official anniversary date March 14th.
